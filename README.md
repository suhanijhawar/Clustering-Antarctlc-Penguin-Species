# Clustering-Antarctlc-Penguin-Species
This project focuses on classifying penguin species using various physical measurements like culmen length, culmen depth, and flipper length. The goal is to build a machine learning model that accurately predicts the species of penguins based on these features.

## Project Overview
- Dataset: The project uses a penguin dataset containing features such as:
    - `culmen_length_mm`
    - `culmen_depth_mm`
    - `flipper_length_mm`
- Objective: The goal is to predict penguin species using these physical features through machine learning techniques.

## Files
- notebook.ipynb: Contains the step-by-step analysis, including:
    - Data loading and exploration
    - Feature engineering and preprocessing
    - Model training and evaluation
- Data: The dataset used in this project, which should be included in the repository (if applicable).

## Dependencies
To run this project, you'll need the following Python packages:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
You can install all dependencies using:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Project Steps
1. Data Exploration:
- Load the dataset and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Visualize the data distributions for various features.

2. Preprocessing:
- Handle missing values, if any.
- Normalize or scale the feature data to prepare it for model training.

3. Modeling:
- Train various classifiers (e.g., Random Forest, Decision Tree) to predict the species based on the physical attributes.
- Perform hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance.

4. Evaluation:
- Evaluate the performance of different models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
- Compare the results to select the best model.

## Results
The final model achieves an accuracy of approximately `X%` (replace with the actual value). Further optimization and feature engineering can help improve the accuracy.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
`git clone <repository-url>`

2. Install dependencies:
